## Localplay Controller API

All controllers and config files are located in /modules/localplay/ they are named with the following conventions. [name of service].controller.php and [name of service].cfg.php. For example if you are using MPD then the names would be mpd.controller.php and mpd.cfg.php The class inside must be Ampache[name of service] in order to avoid conflicts and must extend the localplay_controller class

## Required Functions of Controller

The controller will be called by the Ampache localplay class and must extend the localplay_controller class.
