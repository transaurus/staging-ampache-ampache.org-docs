## Ampache Private Catalogs

Want to organize catalogs so your kids can't hear your music or your wife can safely avoid Malaysian Gore-Grind?

Previously Ampache5 allowed private catalogs which were tied to a single user OR public to everyone.

In Ampache 5.5.0+ you can assign catalogs into filter groups and then assign users to these new groups.

## Enable catalog_filter in your config

Edit your config and enable `catalog_filter`

## Edit your default filter

Go to `admin/filter.php` on your server to view a list of filters.

The 'DEFAULT' group is assigned to new users. When you untick a catalog it is hidden from users in this group.

## Assign new groups to users

When you make your own filter you can assign them to your users from the admin page `admin/users.php`

Simply assign the group to the user and save

## I used to have private catalogs what do I do

If you previously had private catalogs these will be migrated to new groups.

Lets say you have a server with 4 users; 'administrator', 'wifeuser', 'kiduser' and 'generic'

In this example you have 4 catalogs:

* shared music - 'Public Catalog'
* wife music - 'wifeuser'
* kid music - 'kiduser'
* my music - 'administrator'

What happens after you upgrade your server? You will end up with 4 groups:

DEFAULT will have one catalog **shared music** because this was the only public catalog you had.

The generic user will be the only member of DEFAULT because they did not have a private catalog.

All other users will have their own group created as the **username** for that account

* wifeuser
  * wife music
  * shared music
* kiduser
  * kid music
  * shared music
* administrator
  * my music
  * shared music

This should allow you to continue as though nothing has changed!
