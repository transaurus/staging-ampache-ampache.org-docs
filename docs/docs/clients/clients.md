## Ampache 

Ampache runs on a web interface allowing you to play media directly from your web browser. See the [Web Interface](/docs/information/Web-Interface) page for more information.

Thanks to its API, Ampache has also been integrated and can be used with many clients on several platforms. You should take a look at the [API](/docs/clients/api) page for details on how to setup these APIs.

## Playlist only clients

Ampache can generate a URL to stream everything you can play on the site to be used anywhere that supports HTTP streams.

These URL's can be guessed and generated if you know what you're doing but an easy way is to use the playlist generation in Ampache itself.

Simply change your playback type to `Stream`

And then next time you play an item (some items don't update automatically so you might need to reload the page) the `Play` and `Random Play` buttons will now generate a playlist file

This file can be used in any media player or used  to copy the URL to import into different players directly.

If you can use the playlist simply import it into your player.

If you're using Develop (Ampache 6.0.0+) you can use a [Streaming Token](/docs/old-information/ampache6-details#allow-permalink-user-streams) to make these links permanent.
