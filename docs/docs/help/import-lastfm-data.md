## Import Last.FM info into Ampache

Before I started really using Ampache I scrobbled. I had years of information kept in Last.FM and that data is really important.

It keeps track of play counts and flagged (Loved) songs and can help you keep track of what you actually like.

Data is **KING** when your library grows so lets get your history into your new source of truth.

The Last.FM API does have a total play count for your user but we need to export the actual play history as Ampache will delete plays that do not exist in the object_count table.

## Export your data

First up, you need to export your data to a local file.

Download this python export script [lastexport3](https://github.com/lachlan-00/lastscrape-gui/blob/master/lastexport3.py) to pull down the data from Last.FM.

```shell
python3 lastexport3.py -u UserName -o dump.txt
python3 lastexport3.py -u UserName -o loved.txt -t loved
```

**note** this should also work with Libre.FM as long as the export data is the same format using the `--server` parameter

### Example of exported data

The exported data is tab separated (tsv) and will give you the date, title, artist, album and MBID data (if available)

## Import to date into Ampache

The import script has been updated recently to support Python 3.12 and has been tested on Ampache 6+. [update_ampache_from_file2.py](https://github.com/lachlan-00/ampache-scripts/blob/master/update_ampache_from_file2.py)

You can hardcode the variables inside the file or use a CSV config file in the same folder as the update script.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a1a3b8d-1a8b-4d38-9190-6f463c38162f)

If you want to create a config file, call it ampache.csv and put in your details

```csv
# Ampache variables
ampache_url,https://music..com.au
ampache_user,username
ampache_api,supersecretapikey
```

When you have your dump and loved files, copy them and call them dump.txt and loved.txt.

There are CLI switches you can use or manually hardcode things as well in the file.

```shell
/d:filename.txt   Use a different dump file name (default dump.txt)
/l:filename.txt   Use a different loved file name (default loved.txt))
/c:filename.txt   Check a file has the full tab separated rows
/all              print all output rows
/silent           print nothing
/errors or /error print error messages only
```

## Things to remember

You might have some poor data or data that doesn't match your current tags. This script will look for songs that match the data you give it.

I had to manually edit a lot of information as I had fixed up a lot of tags since 2005.

So if you print errors you can see which rows you need to look at, it may take a while but getting the data in Ampache is definitely worth the effort.

You can run this import as many times as you like, the existing play data will not be overwritten.

## Clean up and duplication

There are 2 queries you'll want to run after this is done

When Ampache scrobbles a track it checks against the client agent that made the play. If the agent matches is will skip, if the agent doesn't match it will insert. This lets you play on the web while playing on your phone.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0acd0c57-2a1f-49e5-b666-ef0464f923c8)

When you import it will only reject a scrobble if the agent matches so you'll get dupes. We can find out which ones are duplicates manually. So if you ran this script on top of existing data you will get duplicates (same `object_id`, `object_type`, `date`, `user` but under a different `agent`)

This query will give you an idea of duplicate plays in your database. (I had 3 in my database)

```mysql
SELECT *
FROM `object_count`
WHERE `count_type` = 'stream' AND
      `date` IN (
                 SELECT `date`
                 FROM `object_count`
                 WHERE `count_type` = 'stream' AND
                       `object_type` IN ('song', 'podcast_episode')
                 GROUP BY `object_id`, `object_type`, `date`, `user`, `count_type`
                 HAVING COUNT(CONCAT(`object_id`, `object_type`, `date`, `user`, `count_type`)) > 1
      )
ORDER BY `date`, `object_type`;
```

This action is destructive and will the delete the highest `id` for these plays which will be the most recent inserted row. (we get the dates from songs and podcasts because you can have multiple artist entries for object_count)

```mysql
DELETE FROM `object_count` WHERE `id` IN (
    SELECT `id` FROM (
        SELECT max(`id`) as `id`
        FROM `object_count`
        WHERE `count_type` = 'stream' AND
              `date` IN (
                         SELECT `date`
                         FROM `object_count`
                         WHERE `count_type` = 'stream' AND
                               `object_type` IN ('song', 'podcast')
                         GROUP BY `object_id`, `object_type`, `date`, `user`, `count_type`
                         HAVING COUNT(CONCAT(`object_id`, `object_type`, `date`, `user`, `count_type`)) > 1
        ) GROUP BY `object_id`, `object_type`, `date`, `user`, `count_type`
    ) AS `duplicate`
);
```

The key word here is **destructive** so before you do anything, make sure you back up the database.

I have deleted my stuff so many times over the years and almost lost everything a few times.
