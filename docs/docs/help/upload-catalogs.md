## Set up your catalogs

First up you need to configure catalogs before you can accept uploads.

Check the wiki [Create a Catalog](/docs/installation/catalog) if you have any issues setting up catalogs.

## Configure the upload catalog

Now that you have a place for your uploads you need to configure an `upload_catalog`.

These are all system options which means that you can not set up individual upload_catalogs for each user.

To configure these settings, navigate to the `System` settings page `preferences.php?action=admin&tab=system`

**NOTE** In Ampache7 this was changed to a per-user preference which is available from the options pages.

* Admin `preferences.php?action=admin&tab=options`
* User `preferences.php?tab=options`

Lets explain the settings:

* **Allow user uploads**
  * Enable or disable uploads
* **Allow users to edit uploaded songs**
  * Allow a user to edit their own uploads (Even if they don't have the user permissions)
* **Allow users to remove uploaded songs**
  * Same as Edit this will allow delete permissions for user uploads
* **Consider the user sender as the track's artist**
  * Ignore the tags or manual selection and set the user as the artist
* **Create a subdirectory per user**
  * When you upload a song it will be saved in a directory named after the user who uploaded it

* **Destination catalog**
  * Which catalog is used for uploads? Must be a music folder
* **Post-upload script (current directory = upload target directory)**
  * Run a script from the server after each upload. (Probably shouldn't set this but it's available if you trust everyone)
* **Rename uploaded file according to catalog pattern**
  * This will use the song sorter to read file tags and name itself according to the file tags.
  * If Ampache can't replace all the variables it will be stored in the root directory (or user directory if configured)

## Errors

### Not Found: upload_catalog

This tells us that you haven't selected the catalog where the uploaded files will go.

Make sure you have selected a catalog in System preferences (`preferences.php?action=admin&tab=system`)

### Where are my files

As a User you can browse uploads (`stats.php?action=upload`) in 2 places.

On the main sidebar.

In the user preferences tab

As an Admin you can browse uploads for all users using `Browse Uploads` in the admin tab (Ampache Develop only)

### Uploads don't move to the right place

I've seen some bugs regarding the movement of files when you enable
 `Rename uploaded file according to catalog pattern`.
