## How To Install the Ampache Music Streaming Server on Ubuntu 22.04

TAKEN FROM [howtoforge](https://www.howtoforge.com/how-to-install-the-ampache-music-streaming-server-on-ubuntu-2004/)

Ampache is a free, open-source, and web-based software that allows you to host your own music streaming server. With Ampache, you can access your music and video over the internet. You can view, edit, and play your music via a web browser or any media streaming client.

Features

* Powerful API and streaming to any client
* Flexible catalogs and customization
* Modern HTML5 Web Player
* Support various authorization methods such as MySQL, LDAP, HTTP and PAM
* Compatibility with any Subsonic client

In this tutorial, we will learn how to setup Ampache music streaming server on Ubuntu 22.04.

Prerequisites

* A server running Ubuntu 22.04.
* A root password/sudo access setup on your server.

All of these commands were run as root user using the sudo command

```shell
sudo su -
```

this will change your user to root without having to continually add sudo the each command.

## Getting Started

Before starting, it is a good idea to update your system's package to the latest version.

You can update them using the following command:

```shell
apt-get update -y
apt-get upgrade -y
```

## Install LAMP Server

Ampache runs on the webserver, written in PHP and uses MySQL/MariaDB to store its data. So you will need to install Apache, MariaDB, PHP and other required PHP extensions in your system. You can install them by running the following command:

While Ubuntu 22.04 comes with php8.1, Ampache support for 8.1 isn't considered stable.

For this tutorial we will use php8.0 using [deb.sury.org](https://deb.sury.org/) which allows you to install and use all current stable PHP versions.

Add the sury php ppa and press ENTER to confirm

```shell
add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php
```

After adding the PPA and then update your package list

```shell
apt-get update
```

Install the server packages

This will install everything you need and proabbly some things you don't need.

```shell
apt install apache2 ffmpeg flac gosu inotify-tools lame libavcodec-extra libev-libevent-dev libfaac-dev libmp3lame-dev libtheora-dev libvorbis-dev libvpx-dev mariadb-server php8.0 php8.0-cli php8.0-curl php8.0-gd php8.0-intl php8.0-ldap php8.0-mysql php8.0-xml php8.0-zip vorbis-tools zip unzip
```

Set default php to php 8.0 (if you want. if you haven't installed php before these will probably not be needed)

This will make sure when you type php commands are linked to the version you want.

```shell
update-alternatives --set php /usr/bin/php8.0
update-alternatives --set phpize /usr/bin/phpize8.0
update-alternatives --set php-config /usr/bin/php-config8.0
```

Once all the packages are installed, open the php.ini file and tweak some settings:

```shell
nano /etc/php/8.0/apache2/php.ini
```

If you want to be able to play and download large files it's a good idea to extend the size limits.

```conf
upload_max_filesize = 500M
post_max_size = 500M
```

You should set your server timezone too. [php.net](https://php.net/date.default-latitude)

```conf
date.timezone = Australia/Brisbane
```

Save and close the file when you are finished. Then, restart the Apache service to implement the changes:

```shell
systemctl restart apache2
```

## Configure MariaDB Database

By default, MariaDB is not secured. You can secure it by running the following script:

```shell
mysql_secure_installation
```

Answer all the question as shown below:

```shell
Enter current password for root (enter for none):
Switch to unix_socket authentication [Y/n] N
Set root password? [Y/n] Y
New password:
Re-enter new password:
Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] Y
Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] Y
Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] Y
Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] Y
```

**NOTE** It seems that setting the password above may not be enforced on Ubuntu...

After running through this step you can enforce the localhost password by logging into MariaDB and setting your password manually

```shell
mysql -u root mysql
```

You should get to the MariaDB console

![image](/img/1305249/181388497-94824be3-88e7-4e52-a598-189c15f02be9.png)

Set your password for root and reload the privilege tables.

![image](/img/1305249/181388769-67014c62-f979-4ce1-b872-29c492171f80.png)

```mysql
GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOURPASSWORD' WITH GRANT OPTION;
flush privileges;
```

Use ctrl + c to exit the MariaDB shell and log in to MariaDB shell with your new password:

```shell
mysql -u root -pYOURPASSWORD
```

Did it work? ctrl + c to exit and lets move on

Another thing is make sure your database server is running on a port instead of the socket

```shell
nano /etc/mysql/my.cnf
```

make sure you're running on the port **not** the socketand then restart the server

```shell
systemctl restart mysql
```

### Download Ampache

Now we will download the latest Ampache [release](https://github.com/ampache/ampache/releases) and extract it.

You can download the latest version (for php8.0) of the Ampache using the following command:

```shell
wget https://github.com/ampache/ampache/releases/download/5.4.1/ampache-5.4.1_all_php8.0.zip
```

Once the download is completed, unzip the downloaded file to the Apache web root directory:

```shell
unzip ampache-5.4.1_all_php8.0.zip -d /var/www/ampache
```

## HERE CHOICES BE

Do you want ampache accessible from the hostname? (`https://ampache.mysite.com`)

or as a subfolder? (`https://www.mysite.com/ampache`)

The ampache website is actually in it's own folder (/var/www/ampache/public) so you can point this folder using links depending on what you'd like to do.

### Ampache as a subfolder

The default Apache website folder on Ubuntu is `/var/www/html`

So to make your Ampache site sit as a subfolder; link it as a sub directory of that folder.

```shell
ln -s /var/www/ampache/public /var/www/html/ampache
```

### Ampache as the primary website

If you just want Ampache without anything else you can remove the default files and use that folder for Ampache.

Remove the default website folder

```shell
rm -rf /var/www/html
```

Then link to your website base directory

```shell
ln -s /var/www/ampache/public /var/www/html
```

## Set up the permissions

Next, change the ownership of www directory to www-data:

```shell
chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www
```

The previous guide had a section on creating a music folder and setting permissions.

You should know about mounts and adding your folders to a server before you've gotten this far.

I always prefer to have my web services to have read-only access to my media folders.

## Configure Apache for Ampache

If you want to use HTTPS/SSL connections you can set up your server with a hostname

nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
Add the server hostname to the file above ServerAdmin:

```shell
ServerName ampache.mysite.com
```

Save and close the file when you are finished. Then, check the Apache configuration file for any error with the following command:

```shell
apachectl configtest
```

You should get the following output:

```shell
Syntax OK
```

Next, enable the required apache modules with the following command:

```shell
a2enmod rewrite
```

Finally, restart the Apache service to apply the changes:

```shell
systemctl reload apache2
```

## Secure Ampache with Let's Encrypt SSL

If you're setting up an external site you want to configure SSL.

Make sure certbot is installed [snapcraft.io](https://snapcraft.io/install/certbot/ubuntu)

```shell
apt install snapd
snap install certbot --classic
```

Once installed, run the following command to install the Let's Encrypt SSL for your website.

```shell
certbot --apache -d ampache.mysite.com
```

Follow the process and install an ssl cert with redirection to your server.

If you're just doing it internally for testing lets install!

## Access Ampache Web Interface
