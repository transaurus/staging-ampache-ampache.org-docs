## API4.1 XML Methods

Lets go through come calls and examples that you can do for each XML method.

Remember that Binary data methods will not return xml; just the file/data you have requested.

## Non-Data Methods

## handshake

* MINIMUM_API_VERSION=380001

This is the function that handles verifying a new handshake Takes a timestamp, auth key, and username.

@param array $input
@return boolean

| Input       | Type    | Description                                                                                     | Optional |
|-------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------:|
| 'auth'      | string  | $passphrase (Timestamp . Password SHA hash) OR (API Key)                                        |       NO |
| 'user'      | string  | $username (Required if login/password authentication)                                           |      YES |

## advanced_search

* MINIMUM_API_VERSION=380001
* CHANGED_IN_API_VERSION=400001
* CHANGED_IN_API_VERSION=410001

### Changes to text searches for 410001

* Metadata Search is combined with text and numeric. Refer to the Metadata operator table to see the new order after adding regex to text fields.

### Changes to text searches for 400001

* 'is not' has been added shifting values down the list.
  0=contains, 1=does not contain, 2=starts with, 3=ends with
  4=is, 5=is not, 6=sounds like, 7=does not sound like
* rule_1['name'] is depreciated. Instead of rule_1['name'] use rule_1['title'] (I have put a temp workaround into the search rules to alleviate this change for any existing apps)
* Metadata Search is combined with text and numeric. Meaning that changes to text lists push the numeric fields down.

### Using advanced_search

Perform an advanced search given passed rules. This works in a similar way to the web/UI search pages.
You can pass multiple rules as well as joins to create in depth search results

Rules must be sent in groups of 3 using an int (starting from 1) to designate which rules are combined.
Use operator ('and', 'or') to choose whether to join or separate each rule when searching.

* Rule arrays must contain the following:
  * rule name (e.g. rule_1['title'], rule_2['album'])
  * rule operator (e.g. rule_1_operator[0], rule_2_operator[3])
  * rule input (e.g. rule_1_input['Prodigy'], rule_2_input['Land'])

#### Available search rules

Select the type of search based on the type of data you are searching for. (songs, playlists, etc)

Send the correct input based on the type of search.

| rule_1_input |
|--------------|
| text         |
| integer      |
| boolean      |

**NOTE** To search metadata you need to add a 4th rule "rule_X_subtype"
Operators for metadata are using the text/tag types **AND** numeric types in a single list as they can be ints/strings/dates.
Currently there is not a simple way to identify what metadata types you have saved. New methods will be created for this.
